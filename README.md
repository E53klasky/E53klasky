## Featured Projects

### CAESAR C++ Implementation & ADIOS2 Integration

Converting CAESAR, a foundation model for scientific data compression, from Python to C++ for production HPC environments. This work involves:

- **C++ Port**: Translating the CAESAR compression model to high-performance C++ while maintaining accuracy and improving runtime efficiency
- **ADIOS2 Integration**: Adding CAESAR as a native compression operator in ADIOS2, enabling seamless compression in large-scale scientific simulations
- **HPC Optimization**: Designing for scalability and performance in distributed computing environments

**Tech Stack**: C++, Python, ADIOS2, MPI

**Impact**: Bringing state-of-the-art learned compression to production scientific workflows, enabling researchers to store and transfer massive simulation datasets more efficiently.
